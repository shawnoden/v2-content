To be able to program in ColdFusion, a ColdFusion server needs to be
installed. There are a couple of options available, but the one that we
are going to focus on is setting up and using CommandBox by Ortus Solutions.

CommandBox is a standalone, native tool for Windows, Mac, and Linux that will provide you with a embedded CFML server, Command Line Interface (CLI) for developer productivity, tool interaction, package management,  application scaffolding, and more.

To install CommandBox (ColdFusion), follow the steps below:

## Windows

1. Open up a browser and go to: <https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox>
2. Download `commandbox with JRE`
3. Find downloaded zip which should be in your downloads folder (C:\Users\username\Downloads\)
4. Unzip the zip file into the downloads folder (`commandbox-jre-win64-x.x.x.zip`)
5. Make a shortcut on your desktop to `box.exe`
    1. Right click on `box.exe`, click `Send To` and select `Desktop (create shortcut)`
6. Once unziped, double click on the `box.exe` to install -- the command prompt will appear and run through the setup
7. After install run the following commands in the command line (cmd prompt opens with commandbox install)
    1. cfconfig:        `box install commandbox-cfconfig`
    2. bullet train:    `box install commandbox-bullet-train`
8. CommandBox is now setup and ready to use
9. To use CommandBox to spin up a ColdFusion server to run a site, do the following:
    1.  CD into your site location (ex: cd c:/myCodeExample/site1)
    2.  Now type `box server start cfengine=adobe@2018`
    3.  This will run through the download and installation of Adobe ColdFusion 2018
    4.  When the download and setup of ColdFusion is complete, your site will open up in your default browser
10. If you have a site running, make sure you shut down the site first  
    1.  To shut down the site, type into the command prompt:   `box server stop --all`
11. Anytime you want to close commandBox and you have no sites running, just close the command window with the `x` in the corner, or type `exit`
